## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-12

### üîê Production-Ready Cryptography

#### Real Cryptographic Implementation
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Replaced placeholder decrypt_chunk with real AES-256-GCM decryption
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: Implemented proper key derivation using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations
- **Memory-Safe Key Handling**: All cryptographic key material properly zeroized after use
- **Deterministic Key Derivation**: Symmetric key derivation ensuring both sender and recipient derive identical keys
- **Context-Bound Encryption**: Key derivation includes envelope context to prevent cross-envelope key reuse

#### Digital Receipt System
- **Cryptographically Secure Receipts**: Production-ready digital receipt system with real encryption
- **Ownership Transfer Chains**: Multi-party receipt assignment with cryptographic ownership verification
- **Amount Preservation**: Receipt amounts cryptographically protected through assignment chains
- **Real Decryption**: Fixed assign_receipt to use actual decryption instead of hardcoded values

### üß™ Comprehensive Security Testing

#### Security Attack Scenarios (23 New Tests)
- **Cryptographic Key Isolation**: Ensures only intended recipients can decrypt receipts
- **Signature Forgery Resistance**: Prevents impersonation using Ed25519 signatures
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: Each receipt has unique cryptographic fingerprint
- **Amount Tampering Resistance**: Receipt amounts are cryptographically bound and protected
- **Chain Integrity Validation**: Broken or out-of-order chains are properly rejected
- **Multi-Party Chain Testing**: Complex ownership scenarios (Alice ‚Üí Bob ‚Üí Charlie ‚Üí Dave ‚Üí Eve)
- **Memory Safety Validation**: Cryptographic key material cleanup verification

#### Production Security Properties
- **Real Cryptographic Isolation**: Attackers cannot unseal others' envelopes
- **Tamper Detection**: Any envelope modification breaks cryptographic verification
- **Key Derivation Security**: 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations with proper salt handling
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

### üìä Updated Test Coverage
- **109 Total Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of all production features
- **86 Core Tests**: Envelope encryption, backends, transport, YubiKey integration
- **23 Receipt Tests**: Digital receipt security and attack resistance scenarios
- **Security-First Testing**: All cryptographic operations tested against attack scenarios
