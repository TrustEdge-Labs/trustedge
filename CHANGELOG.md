# Sealedge Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Note — Pre-v6.0 entries:** Entries below v6.0 describe the project under its former name, **trustedge**. Artifact names, binary names, extensions, and env-var prefixes in those entries refer to what shipped at the time. See `MIGRATION.md` §"v6.0" for the rename map. Entries from v6.0 onward use the current brand, **sealedge**.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Sealedge Rebrand

Trademark-driven clean-break rename from **trustedge** to **sealedge**. The project, workspace crates, binary names, file extensions, wire-format constants, and the published GitHub Action are all renamed. No backward-compatibility shims — data encrypted under old constants cannot be decrypted by v6.0 binaries. See [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) for the full rename map.

### Changed (breaking)
- **Crate rename**: every workspace crate renamed from `trustedge-*` to `sealedge-*`. Archive crates `trustedge-trst-*` renamed to `sealedge-seal-*`.
- **Binary rename**: `trustedge` → `sealedge`, `trst` → `seal`, `trustedge-server` → `sealedge-server`, `trustedge-client` → `sealedge-client`, `trustedge-platform-server` → `sealedge-platform-server`, `inspect-trst` → `inspect-seal`.
- **Archive file extension**: `.trst` → `.seal`.
- **Point attestation extension**: `.te-attestation.json` → `.se-attestation.json`.
- **Encrypted key file format**: `TRUSTEDGE-KEY-V1` → `SEALEDGE-KEY-V1` (clean break — v6.0 binaries cannot decrypt keys under the old header).
- **Wire-format constants**: all magic bytes and format strings rewritten to announce the product as sealedge; v2-only envelope format, no v1 decrypt path.
- **GitHub Action rename**: [`TrustEdge-Labs/attest-sbom-action@v1`](https://github.com/TrustEdge-Labs/attest-sbom-action) deprecated in favor of [`TrustEdge-Labs/sealedge-attest-sbom-action@v2`](https://github.com/TrustEdge-Labs/sealedge-attest-sbom-action). The old marketplace listing redirects.
- **Repository URL**: `TrustEdge-Labs/trustedge` → `TrustEdge-Labs/sealedge`. Old URL redirects via GitHub repo rename; local remotes and in-repo links updated.
- **Product references on trustedgelabs.com**: rebranded to Sealedge; live verifier links updated.

### Added
- **`MIGRATION.md`**: complete rename map across crates, binaries, extensions, constants, env vars, GitHub Action, and repository URL; includes a per-user migration checklist for upgrading callers.
- **`scripts/validate-v6.sh`**: reusable v6.0 validation-gate runner — wraps `ci-check.sh`, WASM cargo check + size floor, dashboard build/typecheck, docker compose health + `demo.sh` roundtrip, with a test-count floor (≥ 471) and `--allow-regression "<justification>"` escape hatch.
- **Platform migration `002_seed_anonymous_org.sql`**: seeds the nil-UUID organization so unauthenticated `/v1/verify` requests resolve against a real org row.
- **`RELEASE-NOTES-v6.0.0.md`** and v6.0.0 GitHub release with 5 self-attested assets (`seal`, `seal.sha256`, `seal-sbom.cdx.json`, `seal.se-attestation.json`, `ephemeral.pub`). Dogfoods `sealedge-attest-sbom-action@v2` end-to-end.

### Security
- **rustls-webpki**: bumped to 0.103.13 (RUSTSEC-2026-0104).

### Housekeeping
- `ci-check.sh` now excludes `.claude/` and `node_modules/` from the copyright-header scan.
- `validate-v6.sh` teardown uses `docker compose down -v` to clear the postgres volume between runs.
- Dashboard Sealedge-branded on home (`Sealedge Dashboard` heading + nav) and devices pages (`Registered Sealedge edge devices`).
- Full v6.0 validation gauntlet green: all 8 gates, 1052 tests across the feature matrix, both `workflow_dispatch` runs (`semver.yml`, `wasm-tests.yml`) and the tag-push CI run green on the rename-target repository.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Portfolio Polish

Hardened CI self-attestation and enhanced the published GitHub Action for marketplace readiness.

### Changed
- **CI self-attestation hardened**: Replaced unpinned `curl | sh` syft install with SHA-pinned `anchore/sbom-action@v0.24.0`. Added `continue-on-error: true` so attestation failures never block releases. Renamed `ephemeral.pub` to `build.pub` for clarity.
- **`build.pub` uploaded as release asset**: Verifiers can now independently check attestations using only the release assets (`trst.te-attestation.json` + `build.pub`), with no TrustEdge infrastructure needed.
- **GitHub Action enhanced**: `TrustEdge-Labs/attest-sbom-action@v1` now verifies the SHA256 checksum of the downloaded `trst` binary before executing. Graceful degradation when no checksum file is available. Added `branding` block for GitHub Marketplace listing.
- **Action README rewritten**: Two named usage examples (ephemeral key for CI, persistent key with GitHub Secret). "What you get" section clarifying the action produces a local `.te-attestation.json` file.

### Housekeeping
- Archived te-prove design doc (FOSS supply chain trust policy engine) to `.planning/ideas/` with context note. Parked pending demand evidence.

---

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### SBOM Attestation Wedge

First product feature: cryptographically bind SBOMs to binary artifacts using a lightweight point attestation format, independent of any CI provider.

### Added
- **Point attestation format** (`.te-attestation.json`): Ed25519 signature over BLAKE3 hashes of two artifacts (subject + evidence), random nonce, ISO 8601 timestamp. Generic `subject`/`evidence` schema works for any artifact pair.
- **`trst attest-sbom`**: CLI command to create attestation documents from a CycloneDX SBOM + binary artifact
- **`trst verify-attestation`**: CLI command to verify attestation documents locally, with optional binary/SBOM hash checking
- **`POST /v1/verify-attestation`**: Platform endpoint that verifies point attestations and returns JWS receipts
- **Static HTML verify page**: Browser-based attestation verification at `GET /verify`, served from the platform binary via `include_str!`
- **DigitalOcean App Platform deployment**: `deploy/digitalocean/` with Dockerfile (http-only, no postgres), app.yaml, and deployment guide
- **`scripts/demo-attestation.sh`**: End-to-end SBOM attestation demo (keygen, syft SBOM, attest, verify) in under 60 seconds
- **GitHub Action** (`actions/attest-sbom-action/`): Composite action for one-line CI integration, downloads pre-built `trst` binary
- **CI self-attestation**: Release workflow generates `.te-attestation.json` alongside release binaries using ephemeral keys
- **Product landing page content**: `docs/landing-page.md` with positioning, quick start, and differentiation
- **Third-party attestation guide**: `docs/third-party-attestation-guide.md` with manual and CI workflows
- `PointAttestation` and `ArtifactRef` types in `trustedge-core` (521 lines, 15 unit tests)
- 8 CLI acceptance tests for attest-sbom/verify-attestation
- 5 platform integration tests for /v1/verify-attestation
- `PointAttestationError` enum integrated into `TrustEdgeError`

### Changed
- Platform router serves static verify page at `GET /verify`
- CI workflow includes self-attestation job on release tags
- Test count: 406 -> 471 across 9 workspace crates

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Official Signed Release

First official signed release. All security review findings resolved, documentation current, deployment hardened.

### Changed
- **Configurable receipt TTL**: JWS verification receipts now use `RECEIPT_TTL_SECS` env var (default 3600s) instead of hardcoded 1 hour
- **Strict PORT validation**: Invalid `PORT` env var now causes startup failure with clear error instead of silently defaulting to 3001
- **Envelope::hash() returns Result**: Serialization failures propagate instead of silently hashing empty input via `unwrap_or_default()`
- **generate_aad() uses .expect()**: Documents infallibility intent instead of bare `.unwrap()`
- **Docker Compose credentials**: Moved from inline plaintext to `env_file: deploy/.env` with `.env.example` template

### Security
- `/healthz` no longer exposes exact crate version (prevents version fingerprinting)
- nginx security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, CSP) now present in all location blocks, not just server level
- CSP `connect-src` includes API origin for dashboard API calls
- `deploy/.env` gitignored to prevent credential leaks

### Documentation
- README updated for v3.0 (version badge, Docker quick-start with `.env` step, security posture)
- CLAUDE.md updated (CLI binary table with `trustedge-platform-server`, feature flags including `git-attestation`/`keyring`/`insecure-tls`, Platform Environment Variables section, corrected test counts)
- docs/user/cli.md: all 5 `trst` subcommands documented including `keygen`, `unwrap`, `emit-request`; encrypted key files section added
- docs/architecture.md: corrected Key Modules table (`archive.rs` replaces nonexistent `manifest.rs`)
- docs/developer/testing.md: corrected test counts across all crates

### Added
- `deploy/.env.example` with all platform environment variables documented (PORT, RECEIPT_TTL_SECS, CORS_ORIGINS, JWKS_KEY_PATH, DATABASE_URL, POSTGRES_PASSWORD)

---
