# TrustEdge Dual Licensing Strategy

**Balancing open source community growth with commercial sustainability**

---

## Overview

## Strategic Rationale

### **Why Dual Licensing?**

#### **Community Growth Benefits**
- **Developer Adoption**: MPL-2.0 enables free usage and experimentation
- **Ecosystem Development**: Third-party integrations and contributions
- **Security Auditing**: Open source enables community security review
- **Innovation Feedback**: Real-world usage drives feature development
- **Market Validation**: Community adoption validates product-market fit

#### **Commercial Sustainability Benefits**
- **Revenue Generation**: Enterprise features and support create sustainable business
- **R&D Funding**: Commercial revenue funds continued development
- **Professional Support**: Dedicated resources for enterprise customer success
- **Legal Protection**: Commercial licenses provide IP indemnification
- **Custom Development**: Revenue enables customer-specific feature development

### **Why MPL-2.0 (Not MIT/Apache)?**

#### **Advantages over Permissive Licenses**
- **Contribution Incentive**: File-level copyleft encourages upstream contributions
- **Competitive Protection**: Prevents pure proprietary forks without contribution
- **Community Preservation**: Ensures improvements benefit the community
- **Patent Protection**: Built-in patent grant protects all users

#### **Advantages over Strong Copyleft (GPL/AGPL)**
- **Enterprise Friendly**: Allows proprietary integration and larger works
- **Commercial Flexibility**: Enables dual licensing business model
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Third-party proprietary tools can integrate
- **Adoption Barrier Reduction**: Lower legal friction than GPL/AGPL

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Code Organization**

#### **Core Components (MPL-2.0)**
```
trustedge-core/
├── src/
│   ├── crypto/          # Core encryption algorithms
│   ├── backends/        # Universal backend system
│   │   ├── keyring.rs   # OS keyring integration
│   │   ├── software_hsm.rs # Software HSM backend
│   │   └── yubikey.rs   # YubiKey hardware backend
│   ├── transport/       # Basic transport layer
│   │   └── tcp.rs       # TCP transport implementation
│   └── format.rs        # Core data formats
```

#### **Enterprise Components (Commercial)**
```
trustedge-enterprise/
├── src/
│   ├── backends/
│   │   └── tpm.rs       # TPM 2.0 integration
│   ├── transport/
│   │   ├── quic.rs      # Advanced QUIC transport
│   │   └── ha.rs        # High availability features
│   ├── monitoring/      # Enterprise monitoring
│   ├── auth/           # Enterprise authentication
│   └── compliance/     # Compliance and audit features
```

### **Development Workflow**

#### **Community Contributions**
1. **All contributions** to core components remain MPL-2.0
2. **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** grants dual licensing rights
3. **Community features** developed in public repositories
4. **Security fixes** applied to both editions simultaneously

#### **Enterprise Development**
1. **Enterprise features** developed in private repositories
2. **Commercial customers** get access to enterprise repositories
3. **Feature requests** from enterprise customers prioritized
4. **Custom development** available through professional services

### **Legal Framework**

#### **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**
All contributors must sign a CLA that:
- Grants copyright assignment or broad licensing rights
- Enables dual licensing of contributions
- Protects contributors from patent claims
- Allows relicensing for commercial distribution

#### **Commercial License Terms**
- **Perpetual license** for specific software versions
- **Modification rights** without disclosure requirements
- **Sublicensing rights** for software vendors (additional fee)
- **Indemnification** against IP claims related to TrustEdge
- **Warranty** and support obligations clearly defined
