# Sealedge Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Sealedge is currently in active development. Security updates are provided for:

| Version | Status | Support Level |
| ------- | ------ | ------------- |
| v6.0.x | ✅ Current | Active security fixes |
| main branch | 🔄 Development | Active security fixes |
| v1.0–v5.x | ⏳ Legacy | Best effort |
| < v1.0 | ❌ Unsupported | No security support |

**Note**: As of v1.0, Sealedge follows semantic versioning. Security fixes will be backported to the latest release.

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Implementation

Sealedge implements privacy-preserving edge data encryption with the following security properties:

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600k iterations + AES-256-GCM) for encrypted key files at rest (SEALEDGE-KEY-V1 format); HKDF-SHA256 for envelope key derivation (v1.8+)
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for manifest integrity with domain separation
- **Hashing**: BLAKE3 for content verification
- **Nonce Management**: Deterministic 12-byte nonces (4-byte random prefix + 8-byte counter)
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA OAEP-SHA256 for hybrid encryption (v2.2+)

**Domain Separation**: Manifest signatures use cryptographic domain separation (`b"sealedge.manifest.v1"`) to prevent signature reuse across different contexts or protocols, ensuring signatures cannot be substituted from other systems.

### Known Limitations

1. **Side Channel Attacks**: No specific mitigations implemented
2. **Memory Safety**: Relies on Rust's memory safety guarantees
3. **External Audit**: No third-party security audit completed yet

### Current Security Status (v6.0)

**✅ Implemented Security Features:**
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- Ed25519 digital signatures for provenance with domain separation
- **X25519 ECDH Session Key Exchange**: Automated key derivation during auth handshake with BLAKE3 domain-separated KDF
- **Secret<T> Wrapper Type**: Zeroize-on-drop protection with redacted Debug for all sensitive fields (PINs, passphrases, JWT secrets, passwords)
- **Encrypted Key Files at Rest**: SEALEDGE-KEY-V1 format — PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600k iterations) + AES-256-GCM (v2.2+)
- **HKDF-SHA256 Envelope KDF**: Versioned envelope key derivation replacing legacy PBKDF2 usage (v1.8+)
- **RSA OAEP-SHA256**: Hybrid asymmetric encryption replacing PKCS#1v1.5 padding (v2.2+)
- Connection timeouts and retry logic
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Domain separation prevents cross-context signature reuse
- **DoS Protection**: Resource bounds and limits enforcement
- **Bounds Checking**: Comprehensive validation of chunk sizes and stream limits
- **Length Integrity**: Cryptographic binding of chunk lengths via AAD
- **Mutual Authentication**: Ed25519-based client-server authentication with X25519 ECDH key exchange
- **CORS Hardening**: Restrictive CORS policies for verify-only and postgres platform builds
- **YubiKey Hardware Integration**: Hardware-backed signing and attestation via `yubikey` crate
- **Digital Receipt System**: Cryptographic ownership chains with attack resistance
- **Software Attestation**: Tamper-evident build provenance with Ed25519 signatures
- **45+ Dedicated Security Tests**: Covering timestamp validation, error handling, permissions, and cryptographic correctness (v2.3–v2.4)
- **Multi-Profile Archive Support**: cam.video, sensor, audio, and log archive profiles

**📋 Planned Security Features:**
- TPM and HSM key storage backends
- Key rotation and revocation mechanisms
- Enhanced rate limiting and monitoring
- Security audit logging
- Post-quantum cryptography readiness

### Security Assumptions

- Users manage encryption keys securely
- Network transport provides confidentiality (HTTPS/TLS) - being enhanced
- System entropy source is reliable for cryptographic operations
- Dependencies (aes-gcm, ed25519-dalek, etc.) are trustworthy

### DoS Protection & Resource Bounds

Sealedge implements comprehensive defense-in-depth against denial-of-service attacks:

**Stream-Level Limits:**
- Maximum chunk size: 128MB per chunk
- Maximum records per stream: 1,000,000 records
- Maximum total stream size: 10GB
- Early rejection of oversized requests

**Cryptographic Bounds:**
- Chunk length cryptographically bound via AAD
- Pre-decryption validation of expected sizes
- Post-decryption length verification
- Ciphertext size validation (≤ chunk_size + 16 bytes)

**Memory Protection:**
- Fixed-size buffers where possible
- Streaming processing without full data buffering
- Early termination on bounds violations
- Resource cleanup on validation failures

These protections prevent malicious actors from:
- Exhausting server memory with oversized chunks
- Creating arbitrarily large streams
- Manipulating chunk lengths to cause buffer overruns
- Bypassing validation through length field tampering

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow responsible disclosure practices.
