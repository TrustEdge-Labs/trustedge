# Day 11: Client Authentication Implementation

## Overview
Implement client authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized clients can connect to TrustEdge servers.

## Acceptance Criteria

### üîê Client Certificate Authentication
- [ ] Client certificate loading and presentation
- [ ] Private key management for client certificates
- [ ] Certificate-based client identification
- [ ] Integration with server-side client certificate validation

### üé´ Token-Based Authentication System
- [ ] JWT or similar token authentication support
- [ ] Token generation and validation utilities
- [ ] Token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Configurable token expiration

### üë§ User Credential Management
- [ ] Username/password authentication option
- [ ] Secure credential storage and retrieval
- [ ] Integration with system keyring for credentials
- [ ] Credential validation and error handling

### üõ°Ô∏è Permission-Based Access Control
- [ ] Basic role/permission system
- [ ] Resource-based access control
- [ ] Permission validation for operations
- [ ] Audit logging for access attempts

## Technical Implementation

### CLI Options
```bash
# Client authentication
--client-cert <path>         # Client certificate file
--client-key <path>          # Client private key file
--token <token>              # Authentication token
--token-file <path>          # Token from file
--username <user>            # Username for auth
--password <pass>            # Password (or prompt)
--auth-method <method>       # cert|token|password

# Server authentication settings
--auth-required              # Require client authentication
--auth-methods <methods>     # Allowed auth methods (comma-separated)
--user-db <path>             # User database file
--permission-file <path>     # Permission configuration
```

### Code Structure
- Extend `auth` module with client authentication
- User management and permission system
- Token handling and validation
- Authentication middleware for server

### Authentication Flow
1. Client presents credentials (cert/token/password)
2. Server validates credentials against configured backend
3. Server authorizes access based on permissions
4. Ongoing authentication for long-lived connections

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Certificate authentication logic
- [ ] Token generation and validation
- [ ] Password verification
- [ ] Permission checking logic
- [ ] Error handling for auth failures

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end certificate authentication
- [ ] Token-based authentication flow
- [ ] Password authentication with keyring
- [ ] Permission enforcement testing
- [ ] Multi-user access scenarios

### Security Tests
- [ ] Invalid credential handling
- [ ] Token expiration and refresh
- [ ] Permission bypass attempts
- [ ] Credential storage security

## Documentation Updates

### Files to Update
- [ ] **CLI.md**: Client authentication options and examples
- [ ] **PROTOCOL.md**: Authentication protocol specifications
- [ ] **EXAMPLES.md**: Multi-user scenarios and auth setup
- [ ] **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Authentication testing and development
- [ ] **SECURITY.md**: Authentication security model

### Authentication Scenarios
- [ ] Certificate-based client authentication
- [ ] Token authentication for API access
- [ ] Password authentication with secure storage
- [ ] Multi-user permission management

## Security Considerations

### Credential Security
- Private key protection for client certificates
- Secure token storage and transmission
- Password hashing and storage best practices
- Credential rotation and revocation

### Authentication Security
- Protection against credential stuffing
- Secure authentication error messages
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Session management and timeout

### Permission Security
- Principle of least privilege
- Permission inheritance and delegation
- Audit logging for security events
- Protection against privilege escalation

## Dependencies

### New Crates
- `jsonwebtoken` for JWT token handling
- `argon2` or `bcrypt` for password hashing
- `serde_json` for user/permission data
- Authentication-related dependencies

### Integration Points
- Build on Day 10 server authentication foundation
- Integrate with existing keyring backend system
- Work with current error handling and logging
- Maintain CLI consistency and usability

## Configuration Management

### User Database Format
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user1",
      "auth_methods": ["cert", "password"],
      "certificate_fingerprint": "...",
      "password_hash": "...",
      "permissions": ["read", "write"],
      "roles": ["user"]
    }
  ],
  "roles": {
    "admin": ["read", "write", "manage"],
    "user": ["read", "write"]
  }
}
```

### Permission System
- Resource-based permissions (files, operations)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permission controls
- Configuration file validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated and examples working
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Backward compatibility with unauthenticated mode
- [ ] Integration with Day 10 server authentication

## Estimated Effort
**3-4 days** of development work

## Related Issues
- Depends on: Day 10 server authentication
- Blocks: Day 12 enhanced security features
- Related to: Key management system improvements

## Notes
- Maintain simplicity for single-user scenarios
- Ensure secure defaults for authentication
- Provide migration path from unauthenticated usage
- Consider enterprise authentication integration points
- Focus on usability while maintaining security
