# TrustEdge ‚Äî Trustable Edge AI (Rust)

> Not another CRUD app. Learning Rust through **Trustable Edge AI** ‚Äî privacy-preserving edge pipelines.

---

## Why This Project?

Most people learning Rust start with CRUD web apps. This project stems from an idea: "If I wanted to speak to a LLM, how could I make sure it was private?"

That random thought and an urge to do something out of my comfort zone led to this project, TrustEdge. 

TrustEdge is a learning journey in Rust that aligns with my background in IoT product development, security/PKI and edge systems:

* **Privacy by design**: encrypt at the edge, not just TLS in transit
* **Rust at the edge**: safety + performance for streaming workloads  
* **Learning in public**: small, honest milestones ‚Üí real, reviewable code

**TrustEdge** is a Rust prototype for privacy-preserving, provenance-aware edge audio.

- **Private by default:** audio chunks are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before leaving the device
- **Provenance by design:** each chunk carries a signed manifest (C2PA-inspired) whose hash is bound into AEAD AAD; tampering breaks decryption
- **Streaming-friendly:** fixed nonce discipline (prefix||counter) and per-chunk records

**Technology Stack:**
- Language: Rust (stable)
- Crypto: `aes-gcm` (AEAD), 256-bit keys, 96-bit nonces
- Key Management: Pluggable backends (keyring, TPM, HSM planned)

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install Rust (if needed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/johnzilla/trustedge.git
cd trustedge/trustedge-audio
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage

**Simple File Encryption:**
```bash
# Encrypt file with random key
./target/release/trustedge-audio 
  --input document.txt 
  --envelope document.trst 
  --key-out mykey.hex

# Decrypt file
./target/release/trustedge-audio 
  --decrypt 
  --input document.trst 
  --out recovered.txt 
  --key-hex $(cat mykey.hex)

# Verify integrity
diff document.txt recovered.txt  # Should be identical
```

**Keyring-Based Encryption:**
```bash
# One-time setup: store passphrase
./target/release/trustedge-audio --set-passphrase "my secure passphrase"

# Encrypt with keyring
./target/release/trustedge-audio 
  --input audio.wav 
  --envelope audio.trst 
  --backend keyring 
  --salt-hex $(openssl rand -hex 16)

# Decrypt with keyring
./target/release/trustedge-audio 
  --decrypt 
  --input audio.trst 
  --out recovered.wav 
  --backend keyring 
  --salt-hex <same-salt-as-encryption>
```

### Network Mode

**Start Server:**
```bash
./target/release/trustedge-server 
  --port 8080 
  --decrypt 
  --output-dir ./received 
  --backend keyring 
  --salt-hex $(openssl rand -hex 16)
```

**Send Data from Client:**
```bash
./target/release/trustedge-client 
  --server 127.0.0.1:8080 
  --input data.wav 
  --backend keyring 
  --salt-hex <same-salt-as-server>
```

## How It Works

TrustEdge processes files in configurable chunks (default 4KB) with the following security properties:

1. **Per-Chunk Encryption**: Each chunk encrypted with AES-256-GCM
2. **Signed Manifests**: Ed25519 signatures provide authenticity and provenance
3. **Integrity Binding**: Cryptographic binding prevents tampering and replay attacks
4. **Streaming Support**: Chunks can be processed independently for real-time workflows

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Chunked encryption for memory efficiency
- ‚úÖ Authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- ‚úÖ Pluggable key management backends
- ‚úÖ Network streaming support with robust connection handling
- ‚úÖ Connection timeouts and retry logic with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Graceful server shutdown with signal handling
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Test vector validation for format stability
- ‚úÖ Production-ready network resilience features
