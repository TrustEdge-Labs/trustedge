# TrustEdge Labs LinkedIn Release Post - v0.2.0

Just shipped TrustEdge 0.2.0 with hardware-backed security. This release transforms our open-source crypto engine into something enterprises can actually deploy.

The big additions: YubiKey hardware integration with real ECDSA signatures, 50-200 MB/s encryption performance, and a universal backend system that works with Software HSM, OS Keyring, or hardware modules.

We rebuilt the entire test infrastructure - went from 50 basic tests to 204 comprehensive ones covering real hardware operations. The transport layer now handles multi-client TCP connections and large data transfers.

Organizations building IoT or edge AI solutions can now get cryptographic infrastructure that scales from prototype to production without rebuilding everything.

Commercial licensing available for enterprises. Try the live demo at trustedgelabs.com
