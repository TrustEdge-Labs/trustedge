✦ The trustedge repository has critical flaws rendering it insecure and unmaintainable for a solo developer.

  Summary of Findings:


   1. Critical Security Vulnerability in YubiKey Integration: The yubikey crate uses an untested feature flag, and its implementation (crates/core/src/backends/yubikey.rs) dangerously relies on manual ASN.1 DER encoding for X.509 certificates, with insecure software
      fallbacks.
   2. Unrealistic Scope for a Solo Developer: The project's broad ambition (attestation, receipts, WASM, multiple backends) is unsustainable, creating an unmanageable "tech demo" rather than a focused, secure product.
   3. Code Quality and Dependencies: Manual cryptographic implementations are fragile. Unjustified dependencies increase attack surface. Documentation is misleading and unsubstantiated.

  Specific Recommendations:


   1. Immediate YubiKey Integration Overhaul: Discard manual crypto, adopt battle-tested libraries, and remove "untested" features.
   2. Drastic Scope Reduction: Focus on a single, verifiable problem; prune non-essential features.
   3. Dependency Rationalization: Audit and justify every dependency; remove unnecessary ones.
   4. Eliminate Placeholders: Remove all incomplete or insecure "placeholder" code.
   5. Robust Testing Strategy: Implement comprehensive testing, especially for security-critical paths, with a focus on negative testing.
   6. Accurate Documentation: Rewrite documentation to reflect the actual implemented state, substantiate all claims, and clearly define the threat model.

  High-Level Plan with Milestones:


   * Milestone 1: Security & Scope Rectification (1-2 Weeks)
       * Task 1.1: Overhaul YubiKey integration with secure libraries.
       * Task 1.2: Drastically reduce project scope.
       * Task 1.3: Audit and rationalize all dependencies.
   * Milestone 2: Foundational Stability & Verifiability (2-4 Weeks)
       * Task 2.1: Implement comprehensive core testing.
       * Task 2.2: Reconstruct accurate and transparent documentation.
       * Task 2.3: Eliminate all placeholder code.
   * Milestone 3: Gradual Feature Reintroduction (1 Month+ After M2)
       * Task 3.1: Prioritize and design new features with security in mind.
       * Task 3.2: Implement and test new features securely.
