# TrustEdge Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TrustEdge ("we" or "us").

This contributor license agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Us. To make this document effective, please sign it and send it to Us by electronic submission, following the instructions at [GitHub CLA Process](https://github.com/TrustEdge-Labs/trustedge/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreement-cla). This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it. The Agreement may cover more than one software project managed by Us.

## 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

**"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**"Us"** means **TrustEdge Labs LLC**, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the United States.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. You Retain Copyright

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

**Important**: This Agreement does not transfer copyright ownership. You retain full copyright ownership of Your Contributions. You can continue to use Your Contributions in any way You choose, including licensing them under different terms to other parties.

## 5. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. On Behalf of a Third Party

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Us separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

## 7. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## 8. Dual Licensing and Commercial Use

You understand and agree that TrustEdge Labs LLC may license the Work, including Your Contributions, under multiple licenses, including but not limited to:

- Open source licenses (such as the current MPL-2.0 license)
- Commercial licenses for organizations that require different licensing terms
- Custom licensing arrangements as needed for project sustainability

The revenue from commercial licensing helps fund ongoing development, security audits, infrastructure costs, and long-term project viability.
