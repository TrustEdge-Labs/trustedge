# Developer Certificate of Origin

## Developer Certificate of Origin, Version 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## How to Sign Your Work

To indicate that you agree to the DCO, you must add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages. This is easily done using the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will automatically add a line like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The `Signed-off-by` line certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the material according to the DCO above.

## Why Use DCO?

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. It provides:

- **Legal clarity** for both contributors and the project
- **Simple process** - just add `-s` to your git commits
- **Industry standard** - used by Linux kernel, Docker, and many other major projects
- **No complex paperwork** - unlike CLAs, DCO is handled entirely through Git

For more information about the DCO, see the [original DCO](https://developercertificate.org/).
