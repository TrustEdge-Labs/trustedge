# Software HSM Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

The Software HSM implementation now includes a comprehensive test suite with both **unit tests** and **integration tests** to ensure reliability, security, and real-world functionality.

## Test Coverage Summary

### Unit Tests (33 tests) - [`src/backends/software_hsm.rs`](src/backends/software_hsm.rs)

**Configuration & Initialization (4 tests)**
- ✔ Backend creation with custom and default configurations  
- ✔ Automatic directory creation
- ✔ Metadata persistence across backend restarts
- ✔ Key store directory structure validation

**Key Generation (5 tests)**
- ✔ Ed25519 and P-256 key generation and basic usage
- ✔ Error handling for unsupported algorithms (RSA)
- ✔ Duplicate key handling and replacement behavior  
- ✔ Key file storage verification (32-byte Ed25519 keys)
- ✔ Key metadata tracking and descriptions

**Signing & Verification (8 tests)**
- ✔ Complete signing workflows for both Ed25519 and P-256
- ✔ Error handling for missing keys and algorithm mismatches
- ✔ Signature determinism testing (Ed25519 deterministic, P-256 implementation-dependent)
- ✔ Invalid signature detection and corrupted data handling
- ✔ Multiple signatures from same key with different data
- ✔ Cross-verification failure testing

**UniversalBackend Interface (4 tests)**
- ✔ Complete integration with universal backend system
- ✔ Hash operations (SHA256/SHA512) through universal interface
- ✔ Public key retrieval through CryptoOperation::GetPublicKey
- ✔ Proper rejection of unsupported operations (encryption, key derivation, attestation)

**Error Handling (3 tests)**
- ✔ Corrupted and missing key files graceful handling
- ✔ Invalid signature lengths (too short/long) detection
- ✔ Filesystem error recovery and reporting

**Capabilities & Metadata (4 tests)**
- ✔ Accurate capability reporting (hardware_backed: false, supports_key_generation: true)
- ✔ Key listing with metadata (descriptions, creation times, algorithms)
- ✔ Usage tracking (last_used timestamp updates)
- ✔ Operation support validation for all CryptoOperation types

**Stress & Edge Cases (4 tests)**
- ✔ Large data signing (1MB test data)
- ✔ Empty data edge case handling
- ✔ 100-key operations and management
- ✔ Rapid sequential operations (50 iterations)

**Backend Information (1 test)**
- ✔ Backend identification (name: "software_hsm", version: "1.0.0", available: true)

### Integration Tests (9 tests) - `tests/software_hsm_integration.rs`

**Cross-Session Persistence**
- ✔ Key persistence across backend restarts
- ✔ Metadata file integrity and loading
- ✔ Key file existence verification

**Registry Integration**  
- ✔ UniversalBackendRegistry integration
- ✔ Capability-based backend selection
- ✔ Backend preference handling
- ✔ Operation routing through registry

**File-Based Workflows**
