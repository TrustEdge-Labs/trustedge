# TrustEdge Phase 3 Progress Tracking

This issue tracks the current status and progress of TrustEdge Phase 3 development.

## üéØ Phase 3 Overview
**Goal**: Production-ready network layer with robust connection handling, authentication, and security features.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Day 9: Network Resilience (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
- [x] **Connection Timeouts**: Implemented configurable connection timeouts for client
- [x] **Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff retry mechanism with max attempts
- [x] **Graceful Shutdown**: Server handles SIGINT/SIGTERM with graceful connection cleanup
- [x] **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
- [x] **CLI Options**: New command-line flags for connection management
- [x] **Documentation**: Updated all docs with Day 9 features
- [x] **Testing**: Comprehensive test script demonstrating all features

**Implementation Details**:
- Client: `--connect-timeout`, `--retry-attempts`, `--retry-delay` options
- Server: Graceful shutdown with connection tracking and cleanup
- Both: Improved error messages and status reporting
- Documentation: Updated PROTOCOL.md, CLI.md, EXAMPLES.md, DEVELOPMENT.md

## üîÑ In Progress
