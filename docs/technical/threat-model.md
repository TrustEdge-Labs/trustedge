# TrustEdge Threat Model

**Version**: 2.2
**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Replaces**: August 2025 draft (obsolete — described a different system)

> For vulnerability reporting and security policies, see [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md)

---

## System Overview

TrustEdge is a cryptographic provenance system for edge device data. It proves that data — captured at an edge device — has not been tampered with from capture through to verification, using BLAKE3 continuity chains, Ed25519/ECDSA P-256 signatures, and verifiable receipts. The system provides encryption, attestation, and tamper-evidence for any data type (video, audio, sensor, logs). Device keys are passphrase-protected at rest; hardware-backed keys via YubiKey PIV are also supported.

## Architecture

```
[Edge Device / CLI (trst)]
    |-- keygen: TRUSTEDGE-KEY-V1 (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 600k + AES-256-GCM, passphrase-protected)
    |-- wrap: chunk data -> XChaCha20-Poly1305 + BLAKE3 chain -> Ed25519/ECDSA P-256 sign
    |-- unwrap: verify signature + BLAKE3 chain -> HKDF key derivation -> decrypt chunks
         |
         v
[.trst Archive] ─── HTTP POST /v1/verify ───> [Platform Server (Axum)]
                                                     |-- JWT bearer auth (Secret<T>, ZeroizeOnDrop)
                                                     |-- BLAKE3 + Ed25519/ECDSA P-256 verify
                                                     |-- PostgreSQL (receipts, devices, orgs)
                                                     |-- JWKS endpoint
                                                     |-- CORS restricted (same-origin or header-limited)
                                                     v
                                              [Cryptographic Receipt (JWS)]
                                                     |
                                              [Dashboard (SvelteKit + nginx)]
                                              [Browser WASM (trst-wasm)]

[Network Transport (optional)]
    |-- TCP with framing (trustedge-core transport)
    |-- QUIC with TLS (webpki-roots trust store, secure-by-default)
         insecure-tls feature: compile-time blocked in release builds (build.rs guard)
```

### Docker Compose Stack

```
platform-server (Rust, Axum HTTP) <-> postgres (internal network, no external port)
                                  <-> dashboard (nginx static, port 3000)
```

---

## Cryptographic Primitives

| Primitive | Algorithm | Where Used | Notes |

## Threat Categories

### T1: Data Tampering in Transit

**Description**: An adversary intercepts and modifies archive data or verification responses during network transmission.

**Attack Vectors**: Active network position (MITM), packet injection, TLS stripping.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- AES-GCM authentication tags on each chunk — any modification is detected before decryption
- Ed25519 or ECDSA P-256 signature over the canonical manifest.json — signature verification is the first step in `trst verify` and `/v1/verify`
- BLAKE3 continuity chain — any missing, reordered, or substituted chunk breaks the chain from genesis seed
- `trst unwrap` enforces verify-then-decrypt: signature and chain must pass before any chunk is decrypted

---

### T2: Data Tampering at Rest

**Description**: An adversary modifies a .trst archive after it has been written to disk or object storage.

**Attack Vectors**: Direct filesystem access, storage layer manipulation, corrupt-and-replace.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- .trst archives are tamper-evident read-only bundles: manifest.json + detached signature + encrypted chunks
- Ed25519/ECDSA P-256 signature over manifest.json; any manifest change invalidates the signature
- BLAKE3 continuity chain links all chunks back to the genesis seed — any chunk substitution or addition breaks the chain
- Chunk filenames are zero-padded indices; gaps or reordering are detected during verification

---

### T3: Key Compromise (Private Key at Rest)

**Description**: An adversary obtains a device's private signing key from disk storage.

**Attack Vectors**: Filesystem access, disk theft, memory dumps, backup exfiltration.

**Status**: MITIGATED (v2.2)

**Mitigations**:
- TRUSTEDGE-KEY-V1 format: private key encrypted with AES-256-GCM; encryption key derived via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600,000 iterations, 32-byte salt per OWASP 2023)
- Passphrase prompted at runtime via `rpassword` — never stored on disk or in environment variables
- `--unencrypted` flag available as explicit opt-in for CI/automation environments; requires conscious operator choice
- Hardware option: YubiKey PIV slot 9c — private key is generated on hardware and never extractable; software only holds the public certificate

---

### T4: RSA Padding Oracle / Timing Side-Channel (RUSTSEC-2023-0071)

**Description**: An adversary exploits PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption timing variations to recover RSA private keys via the Marvin Attack.

**Attack Vectors**: Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, statistical timing measurement of decryption responses.

**Status**: MITIGATED (v2.2)

**Mitigations**:
- PKCS#1 v1.5 (`Pkcs1v15Encrypt` trait) completely eliminated from codebase in v2.2
- All RSA operations now use OAEP with SHA-256 (`Oaep::new::<sha2::Sha256>()`) — not vulnerable to RUSTSEC-2023-0071
- RUSTSEC-2023-0071 removed from `.cargo/audit.toml` ignore list; `cargo-audit` now passes with zero suppressed advisories

See **RSA Vulnerability History** section for full timeline.

---

### T5: Weak Key Derivation

**Description**: An adversary performs offline brute-force or dictionary attacks against stored key material, or exploits incorrect use of a KDF for its input type.

**Attack Vectors**: Offline dictionary attack against TRUSTEDGE-KEY-V1 files, rainbow tables, GPU brute-force.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- `PBKDF2_MIN_ITERATIONS = 300_000` constant in `universal.rs`; enforced at builder level (assert!) and backend level (error return) — belt-and-suspenders
- Default iteration count: 600,000 (OWASP 2023 PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 recommendation)
- Envelope key derivation uses HKDF-SHA256 (RFC 5869): correct KDF for high-entropy input (ECDH shared secret) per NIST SP 800-56C; PBKDF2 is not appropriate for high-entropy seeds

---

### T6: Legacy Envelope Format

**Description**: An adversary or implementation bug exploits the weaker v1 envelope format (PBKDF2 per-chunk KDF, random nonces) that was present through v1.8.

**Attack Vectors**: Downgrade attack, tooling that re-introduces v1 handling, nonce collision in high-volume usage.

**Status**: MITIGATED (v2.2)

**Mitigations**:
- v1 envelope format removed entirely in v2.2 — no code path produces or consumes v1 envelopes
- Codebase is v2-only: single HKDF derivation per envelope, deterministic counter nonces (nonce_prefix[8] || chunk_index[3] || last_flag[1] = 12-byte nonce), no per-chunk re-derivation
- HKDF domain separation: info parameter = "TRUSTEDGE_ENVELOPE_V1" binds the derived key to TrustEdge context

---

### T7: Insecure Transport

**Description**: An adversary intercepts network communications using weak or absent TLS, or exploits a debug/testing bypass left enabled in production.

**Attack Vectors**: TLS downgrade, self-signed cert acceptance in production, `insecure-tls` feature left enabled.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- QUIC transport uses `webpki-roots` trust store by default — consistent cross-platform certificate validation
- `insecure-tls` is a compile-time feature flag; `build.rs` includes a compile-time guard that prevents release builds from enabling `insecure-tls` (uses `cfg!(not(debug_assertions))` check — not a runtime config)
- Docker Compose stack: platform-server and postgres communicate over Docker internal network; postgres port is not exposed externally; dashboard served via nginx with TLS termination upstream

---

### T8: Replay Attacks on Verification

**Description**: An adversary captures a valid verification request or receipt and replays it to obtain an additional receipt for content it does not control.

**Attack Vectors**: Network capture and replay of `/v1/verify` HTTP requests, re-submission of previously verified archives.

**Status**: PARTIAL

**Mitigations (implemented)**:
- Cryptographic receipts are bound to specific archive content via BLAKE3 digest — a receipt for archive A cannot be claimed as a receipt for archive B
- Per-chunk deterministic counter nonces prevent chunk-level replay (each chunk's nonce is unique by construction)
- Mutual auth challenge-response uses BLAKE3 domain-separated KDF with time-limited sessions — replaying a session handshake outside the session window fails

**Planned**:
- Sliding-window nonce validation for high-volume `/v1/verify` endpoints
- Request-level idempotency tokens with server-side deduplication

---

### T9: Dashboard / API Authentication Bypass

**Description**: An adversary gains access to the platform API or dashboard without valid credentials, or exploits CORS misconfigurations to make cross-origin requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Attack Vectors**: Missing auth middleware, JWT algorithm confusion, CORS wildcard, credential theft via XSS.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- JWT bearer tokens required for all platform endpoints except `/healthz` (excluded for Docker health checks)
- JWT secret stored in `Secret<T>` with `ZeroizeOnDrop` — never serialized, never logged, zeroed on drop
- `LoginRequest` password wrapped in `Secret<T>` at JSON parse boundary via private raw struct — no exposure window
- CORS: `CorsLayer::new()` (same-origin only) for verify-only builds; restricted to `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, `Accept` headers for postgres builds
- CI Step 23: grep-based check prevents regression of `#[derive(Serialize)]` on secret-holding structs

---

### T10: Secret Material in Memory

**Description**: Sensitive values (private keys, passphrases, PINs, JWT secrets, database passwords) remain in memory after use, accessible via memory dumps, core files, or debug logging.

**Attack Vectors**: Process memory inspection, crash dumps, debug logging of config structs.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- `Secret<T>` wrapper type (in-house, using `zeroize` crate): implements `ZeroizeOnDrop` on all secret-holding fields
- Covered fields: YubiKey PIV PIN, passphrase (key-at-rest), JWT secret, database password
- `Debug` impl on `Secret<T>` outputs `[REDACTED]` — prevents accidental logging
- No `Display`, `Deref`, or `Serialize` derives on `Secret<T>` — prevents inadvertent exposure
- CI Step 23 enforces no regression: any `Serialize` derive added to a struct holding a `Secret<T>` field fails CI
- Rust memory safety prevents use-after-free of secret material

---

### T11: Supply Chain (Dependency Vulnerabilities)

**Description**: A vulnerability in a transitive Rust dependency introduces a security flaw, or a malicious package is introduced into the build.

**Attack Vectors**: Compromised crate on crates.io, unpinned dependencies drifting to vulnerable versions.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- `cargo-audit` integrated as a blocking CI check — every build scans against the RustSec advisory database
- `Cargo.lock` tracked in git — audits run against exact pinned versions, not resolved-at-build-time versions
- RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (RSA Marvin Attack) was the only suppressed advisory; it is now resolved and removed from `.cargo/audit.toml`
- CI now passes with zero suppressed advisories

---

### T12: YubiKey Hardware Failure / Silent Fallback

**Description**: YubiKey hardware becomes unavailable and the system silently falls back to software key operations, defeating the hardware isolation guarantee.

**Attack Vectors**: YubiKey disconnect, PIV applet error, driver failure, supply chain substitution.

**Status**: MITIGATED

**Mitigations**:
- Fail-closed design: hardware unavailable = error returned to caller; no silent software fallback
- `ensure_connected()` is called at the start of every PIV operation — gates all hardware-backed operations
- 18 simulation tests + 9 hardware integration tests; all tests use real assertions, not placeholder values
- ECDSA P-256 signing via PIV slot 9c: private key is generated on hardware and is non-exportable by design

---

## RSA Vulnerability History

This section documents the full lifecycle of RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Marvin Attack) in TrustEdge.

**The advisory**: The `rsa` crate's PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption (`Pkcs1v15Encrypt`) is vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack (Marvin Attack) that enables adaptive chosen-ciphertext recovery of RSA private keys. Published 2023; CVE pending.

**v1.3 (2026-02-13) — Risk Accepted**

During cargo-audit integration, RUSTSEC-2023-0071 was identified against the `rsa` crate used in `hybrid.rs`. At the time, TrustEdge's RSA usage was limited to `hybrid.rs`, which was used for non-production asymmetric encryption scenarios. The advisory was risk-accepted with documented rationale and added to `.cargo/audit.toml` ignore list.

Rationale: TrustEdge's primary encryption path (AES-256-GCM) was unaffected. RSA in `hybrid.rs` was not used in the primary data lifecycle. Risk was acknowledged as a known limitation.

**v1.3 through v2.1 — Carried as Known Risk**

The advisory remained in `.cargo/audit.toml` with the risk-accepted rationale. Any use of `hybrid.rs` RSA decryption was potentially vulnerable to timing-based key recovery if an adversary could measure decryption response times.

**v2.2 Phase 45 (2026-03-19) — Fully Resolved**

`Pkcs1v15Encrypt` was replaced with `Oaep::new::<sha2::Sha256>()` in `asymmetric.rs` (`hybrid.rs`). OAEP does not have the timing side-channel vulnerability present in PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption.

RUSTSEC-2023-0071 was removed from `.cargo/audit.toml`. `cargo-audit` now passes with no suppressed advisories. The codebase contains no remaining PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption code.

## Out of Scope

The following are acknowledged but outside the current threat model:

- **TPM support** — planned for a future milestone; no hardware available to test against
- **Post-quantum cryptography** — research phase only; no production use case
- **Physical device security** — OS-level and environmental security are operator responsibilities
- **Regulatory compliance** — GDPR, CCPA, and sector-specific requirements are implementation-site concerns
- **Social engineering** — attacks against operators or administrators

---

## Document Maintenance

This document must be reviewed:
- Before each major release
- After any security incident
- When the cryptographic primitive set changes

Next scheduled review: before v2.3 or next major milestone.
