## üîß Code Contributions

### Development Setup

1. **Install Rust**: Use the latest stable version
2. **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/trustedge/trustedge.git`
3. **Install dependencies**: `cd trustedge/trustedge-audio && cargo build`
4. **Run tests**: `cargo test` and `cargo clippy`

### Project Board Management

**Important**: GitHub project boards require manual addition of issues.

- **View project board**: [TrustEdge Development](https://github.com/users/johnzilla/projects/2)
- **Add issues to board**: Use `./scripts/project/manage-board.sh`
- **GitHub Issues vs Project Board**: All issues are in `/issues`, but only manually added ones appear on the project board

### Coding Standards

**Follow the comprehensive coding standards**: See [CODING_STANDARDS.md](./CODING_STANDARDS.md) for detailed guidelines.

**Key requirements**:
- **Style**: Follow standard Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- **Linting**: Pass all Clippy checks (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- **Terminal output**: Use professional UTF-8 symbols (‚úî, ‚úñ, ‚ö†, ‚óè, ‚ô™, ‚ñ†) instead of emojis
- **Testing**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Include doc comments for public APIs
- **Error handling**: Use proper error types and actionable messages
- **Security**: Follow cryptographic best practices

### Code Quality Requirements

See [CODING_STANDARDS.md](./CODING_STANDARDS.md) for detailed requirements. Essential checks:

- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Clippy passes without errors (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] Professional UTF-8 symbols used (no emojis in terminal output)
- [ ] New code includes appropriate tests

## üìÑ Copyright and Licensing

### Copyright Headers for Contributions

**For external contributors**: When you submit a PR, you have several options for copyright headers:

#### Option 1: Contributor Copyright (Recommended)
```rust
// Copyright (c) 2025 Your Name
// Copyright (c) 2025 John Turner  
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
// If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
//
// Project: trustedge ‚Äî Privacy and trust at the edge.
//
```

#### Option 2: Assignment to Project
```rust
// Copyright (c) 2025 John Turner
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
// If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
//
// Project: trustedge ‚Äî Privacy and trust at the edge.
//
```

#### Option 3: Collective Copyright
```rust
// Copyright (c) 2025 TrustEdge Contributors
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
// If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
//
// Project: trustedge ‚Äî Privacy and trust at the edge.
//
```

### What We Recommend

1. **For substantial contributions** (new files, major features): Use **Option 1** with your name first
2. **For minor changes** (bug fixes, small improvements): Use **Option 2** or let maintainers add appropriate headers
3. **When in doubt**: Use **Option 1** - you retain copyright while licensing under MPL-2.0

### Legal Framework

- **License**: All contributions are licensed under MPL-2.0 for open-source use
- **CLA Required**: Contributors must sign our CLA before code can be merged
- **Copyright retention**: Contributors retain copyright on their original work
- **Dual licensing**: CLA enables commercial licensing to sustain the project
- **Clean IP**: Ensure you have the right to contribute your code

### For Maintainers

When accepting external PRs:

1. **Verify CLA is signed** via the CLA Assistant bot status
2. **Verify copyright headers** are appropriate for the contribution size
3. **Respect contributor copyright** - don't change their copyright line without permission  
4. **For major contributions**: Ensure Option 1 format is used
5. **For collaborative files**: Consider using collective copyright (Option 3)

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

### Why We Require a CLA

All code contributions to TrustEdge require signing our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). We want to be transparent about why this is necessary and what it means for you as a contributor.

**TL;DR**: You keep the copyright to your work, but you give the project permission to use it in flexible ways that help sustain the project long-term.

### What the CLA Means

#### üè† **You Retain Copyright**
The CLA is **not** a copyright assignment. You will always own the copyright to your original contributions. Your name stays on your code, and you can use your contributions however you wish.

#### üìú **Project Gets Usage Rights**
The CLA grants TrustEdge (John Turner) a broad, perpetual, and irrevocable license to:
- Use your contribution in the open-source version
- Modify and improve your contribution
- Sublicense your contribution under different terms when necessary

#### üíº **Why This Matters: Dual-Licensing Strategy**
TrustEdge uses a **dual-licensing model** to ensure project sustainability:

- **Open-Source License (MPL-2.0)**: Free for everyone to use, modify, and distribute
- **Commercial License**: Available for organizations that need different licensing terms

The revenue from commercial licensing helps fund:
- ‚úÖ **Ongoing development** and maintenance
- ‚úÖ **Security audits** and professional reviews  
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure costs** (CI/CD, hosting, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Long-term project viability** and feature development

Without the CLA, we couldn't offer commercial licenses, which would limit our ability to sustain and grow the project professionally.

### ü§ñ How It Works

1. **Automated Process**: When you submit your first pull request, the CLA Assistant bot will automatically appear
2. **One-Time Signing**: You only need to sign once - it covers all future contributions
3. **Digital Signature**: Quick online process, no printing or mailing required
4. **Immediate Access**: Once signed, your PR can be reviewed and merged

### üìã CLA Document

The full CLA document is available here: **[TrustEdge CLA](https://gist.github.com/johnzilla/0624a138cdabd17e9f5ae44607958922)** 

### Questions About the CLA?

We believe in transparency. If you have questions about:
- What rights you're granting
- How commercial licensing works  
- Why the CLA is structured this way
- Your copyright protections

Please [open a discussion](https://github.com/johnzilla/trustedge/discussions) or reach out via [email](mailto:john@trustedge.dev). We're happy to explain our approach and reasoning.
