## üìÑ Copyright and Licensing

### Copyright Headers for Contributions

**For external contributors**: When you submit a PR, you have several options for copyright headers:

#### Option 1: Contributor Copyright (Recommended)
```rust
// Copyright (c) 2025 Your Name
// Copyright (c) 2025 TRUSTEDGE LABS LLC  
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
// If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
//
// Project: trustedge ‚Äî Privacy and trust at the edge.
//
```

#### Option 2: Assignment to Project
```rust
// Copyright (c) 2025 TRUSTEDGE LABS LLC
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
// If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
//
// Project: trustedge ‚Äî Privacy and trust at the edge.
//
```

#### Option 3: Collective Copyright
```rust

// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
// If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
//
// Project: trustedge ‚Äî Privacy and trust at the edge.
//
```

### What We Recommend

1. **For substantial contributions** (new files, major features): Use **Option 1** with your name first
2. **For minor changes** (bug fixes, small improvements): Use **Option 2** or let maintainers add appropriate headers
3. **When in doubt**: Use **Option 1** - you retain copyright while licensing under MPL-2.0

### Legal Framework

- **License**: All contributions are licensed under MPL-2.0 for open-source use
- **DCO Required**: All commits must be signed-off with the Developer Certificate of Origin
- **CLA Required**: Contributors must sign our CLA before code can be merged
- **Copyright retention**: Contributors retain copyright on their original work
- **Dual licensing**: CLA enables commercial licensing to sustain the project
- **Clean IP**: Ensure you have the right to contribute your code

---

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions to this repository must be accompanied by a sign-off indicating that you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](./DCO.md). This is a lightweight way for contributors to state that they have the right to submit their work.

### How to Sign Your Commits

You can do this by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to your Git commit messages:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will automatically add a line like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### What the DCO Means

The DCO is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make your contribution. By signing off on your commits, you certify that:

- You wrote the code or have the right to submit it under the project's license
- You understand that the contribution and your sign-off are publicly recorded
- You agree to the terms outlined in the [full DCO text](./DCO.md)

### Why Use DCO?

- **Industry standard**: Used by Linux kernel, Docker, and many major open source projects
- **Simple process**: Just add `-s` to your git commits
- **Legal clarity**: Provides clear rights and responsibilities
- **No paperwork**: Handled entirely through Git

### For Maintainers

When reviewing PRs:

1. **Verify DCO sign-off** is present on all commits
2. **Check that email matches** the contributor's GitHub account
3. **Ensure all commits in the PR are signed off**
4. **Request sign-off** if missing before merging

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

### Why We Require a CLA

All code contributions to TrustEdge require signing our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). We want to be transparent about why this is necessary and what it means for you as a contributor.

**TL;DR**: You keep the copyright to your work, but you give the project permission to use it in flexible ways that help sustain the project long-term.

### What the CLA Means

#### üè† **You Retain Copyright**
The CLA is **not** a copyright assignment. You will always own the copyright to your original contributions. Your name stays on your code, and you can use your contributions however you wish.

#### üìú **Project Gets Usage Rights**
The CLA grants TrustEdge Labs LLC a broad, perpetual, and irrevocable license to:
- Use your contribution in the open-source version
- Modify and improve your contribution
- Sublicense your contribution under different terms when necessary

#### üíº **Why This Matters: Dual-Licensing Strategy**
TrustEdge uses a **dual-licensing model** to ensure project sustainability:

- **Open-Source License (MPL-2.0)**: Free for everyone to use, modify, and distribute
- **Commercial License**: Available for organizations that need different licensing terms

The revenue from commercial licensing helps fund:
- ‚úÖ **Ongoing development** and maintenance
- ‚úÖ **Security audits** and professional reviews  
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure costs** (CI/CD, hosting, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Long-term project viability** and feature development

Without the CLA, we couldn't offer commercial licenses, which would limit our ability to sustain and grow the project professionally.

### ü§ñ How It Works

1. **Automated Process**: When you submit your first pull request, the CLA Assistant bot will automatically appear
2. **One-Time Signing**: You only need to sign once - it covers all future contributions
3. **Digital Signature**: Quick online process, no printing or mailing required
4. **Immediate Access**: Once signed, your PR can be reviewed and merged

### üìã CLA Document

The full CLA document is available here: **[TrustEdge CLA](https://github.com/TrustEdge-Labs/trustedge/blob/main/CLA.md)** 

### Questions About the CLA?

We believe in transparency. If you have questions about:
- What rights you're granting
- How commercial licensing works  
- Why the CLA is structured this way
- Your copyright protections

Please [open a discussion](https://github.com/TrustEdge-Labs/trustedge/discussions) or reach out via [email](mailto:john@trustedge.dev). We're happy to explain our approach and reasoning.
