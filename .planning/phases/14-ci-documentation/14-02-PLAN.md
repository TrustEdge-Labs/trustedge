<objective>
Update root README.md to document the stable vs experimental crate split established in Phase 13. Verify all experimental crate READMEs have banners (done in Phase 13, confirm no regression).

Purpose: Users and contributors immediately understand which crates are production-committed and which are experimental, directly from the project README.
Output: Updated README.md with crate classification section.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add crate classification to root README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
  Update the root README.md to reflect the stable/experimental crate split:

  1. **Update the "Crate Overview" table** in the "Project Architecture" section. Add a "Tier" column to the existing table showing tier classification. The table currently lists all 10 crates. Add a column with values:
     - "Stable" for: trustedge-core, trustedge-cli, trustedge-trst-cli, trustedge-trst-protocols, trustedge-trst-wasm
     - "Experimental" for: trustedge-attestation, trustedge-receipts, trustedge-wasm, trustedge-pubky, trustedge-pubky-advanced

  2. **Add a "Crate Classification" subsection** right after the architecture tree diagram (before the "Crate Overview" table). Content:

  ```markdown
  ### Crate Classification

  TrustEdge uses a 2-tier classification system:

  | Tier | Crates | CI Policy | Maintenance |
  |------|--------|-----------|-------------|
  | **Tier 1 (Stable)** | core, cli, trst-protocols, trst-cli, trst-wasm | Full CI (blocking) | Actively maintained |
  | **Tier 2 (Experimental)** | wasm, pubky, pubky-advanced, receipts, attestation | Build-only (non-blocking) | No maintenance commitment |

  **Tier 1** crates are production-committed and receive comprehensive testing in CI. Failures block merge.

  **Tier 2** crates are community contributions or experimental. They build in CI but failures do not block core development. See individual crate READMEs for details.
  ```

  3. **Update "What's New" section**: Add a brief mention of v1.2 changes below the v1.0 block:

  ```markdown
  **v1.2 Scope Reduction** -- crate classification (stable/experimental tiers), dependency audit and optimization, tiered CI pipeline.
  ```

  4. **Do NOT change**: License section, security section, commercial section, quick start, demos, or any other content. Only modify the architecture/crate sections and the version history.

  5. **No emoji rule**: The README currently uses emoji in section headers and bullet points. Do NOT add new emoji. Do NOT remove existing emoji (that would be a gratuitous change). Only add the new content without emoji.
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. Verify README.md contains "Crate Classification" section
  2. Verify the crate overview table has a "Tier" column
  3. Verify "Tier 1" appears for the 5 stable crates
  4. Verify "Tier 2" or "Experimental" appears for the 5 experimental crates
  5. Verify v1.2 is mentioned in the version history
  </verify>
  <done>
  Root README clearly documents the 2-tier crate classification with a dedicated section and updated crate table. Users can immediately identify which crates are production-committed vs experimental.

  <name>Task 2: Verify experimental crate README banners</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
  Phase 13 (Plan 13-01) added experimental banners to all 5 tier-2 crate READMEs. Verify this is still the case (no regression since Phase 13):

  1. Check each experimental crate README for "EXPERIMENTAL" text:
     - `crates/wasm/README.md` — should have "EXPERIMENTAL" banner
     - `crates/pubky/README.md` — should have "EXPERIMENTAL" banner
     - `crates/pubky-advanced/README.md` — should have "EXPERIMENTAL" banner
     - `crates/receipts/README.md` — should have "EXPERIMENTAL" banner
     - `crates/attestation/README.md` — should have "EXPERIMENTAL" banner

  2. If any banner is missing, add one following the pattern from Phase 13-01:
     ```
     > **EXPERIMENTAL** -- This crate is Tier 2 (experimental). [brief description]. No maintenance commitment.
     ```

  3. This is a verification task. If all banners exist, no file changes needed. Log the verification result.
  </action>
  <verify>
  Run: `grep -l "EXPERIMENTAL" crates/wasm/README.md crates/pubky/README.md crates/pubky-advanced/README.md crates/receipts/README.md crates/attestation/README.md`
  All 5 files should match.
  </verify>
  <done>
  All 5 experimental crate READMEs confirmed to have prominent EXPERIMENTAL banners. DOCS-02 requirement verified.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. README.md has "Crate Classification" section with tier table
2. README.md crate overview table includes tier column
3. All 5 experimental crate READMEs have "EXPERIMENTAL" banner (grep confirms)
4. All 5 stable crate READMEs have tier markers (from Phase 13)
5. No unrelated README content changed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- DOCS-01: Root README clearly documents stable vs experimental crate split
- DOCS-02: All experimental crate READMEs have experimental/beta banner (verified, not newly created)
- README changes are additive (no existing content removed or altered)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/14-ci-documentation/14-02-SUMMARY.md`
