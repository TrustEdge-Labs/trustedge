# Phase 32 Plan 01: Workspace Cleanup Summary

**Deleted trustedge-receipts and trustedge-attestation deprecated facade crates from workspace — 9 files removed, workspace builds cleanly, 154 core tests pass**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-22T18:24:31Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22T18:25:22Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 3 (Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock) + 9 deleted

## Accomplishments
- Deleted `crates/receipts/` directory (trustedge-receipts re-export facade)
- Deleted `crates/attestation/` directory (trustedge-attestation re-export facade)
- Removed both crates from workspace `members` list in root Cargo.toml
- Removed both crates from Crate Classification comment block in Cargo.toml
- Verified workspace builds cleanly and 154 trustedge-core library tests pass

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Delete facade crate directories and remove from workspace** - `c4b201b` (chore)

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit pending)

## Files Created/Modified
- `Cargo.toml` - Removed `crates/attestation` and `crates/receipts` from workspace members and classification comment
- `Cargo.lock` - Updated to remove facade crate entries (auto-regenerated by cargo)
- `crates/attestation/` - Deleted (Cargo.toml, README.md, src/lib.rs, test-artifact.sh)
- `crates/receipts/` - Deleted (Cargo.toml, README.md, src/lib.rs)

## Decisions Made
- Deleted facade crates without a deprecation period — they were not published to crates.io so no yanking was needed, and git history preserves their content for reference

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Workspace is clean — 10 members remaining (down from 12 + examples)
- Ready for subsequent workspace cleanup plans in phase 32
