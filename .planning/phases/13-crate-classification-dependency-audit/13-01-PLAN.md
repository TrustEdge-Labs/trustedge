<objective>
Classify all 10 workspace crates into stable (Tier 1) and experimental (Tier 2) with Cargo.toml metadata, workspace documentation, and README banners for experimental crates.

Purpose: Establish clear maintainability boundaries so a solo developer knows which crates are production-committed vs community/experimental. This is the foundation for Phase 14's CI prioritization.
Output: All Cargo.toml files updated with tier metadata, workspace Cargo.toml documented, experimental READMEs bannered, facade crates reclassified.

Tier classification:
- **Tier 1 (Stable):** core, trustedge-cli, trst-protocols, trst-cli, trst-wasm
- **Tier 2 (Experimental):** wasm, pubky, pubky-advanced, receipts, attestation

Key constraint: v1.2 is "mark, not destroy" — no crate deletion, just classification.

Facade crates (receipts, attestation) currently say "DEPRECATED: Use trustedge-core instead" in description. Reclassify to experimental with no maintenance commitment (per CLSF-04).

  <name>Task 1: Add tier metadata to all Cargo.toml files and document in workspace</name>

    **1. Add `[package.metadata.trustedge]` section to all 10 crate Cargo.toml files.**

    For the 5 **stable** crates (core, trustedge-cli, trst-protocols, trst-cli, trst-wasm), add after existing `[package.metadata.*]` sections (or after `[package]` if none exist):

    ```toml
    [package.metadata.trustedge]
    tier = "stable"
    maintained = true
    ```

    For the 5 **experimental** crates (wasm, pubky, pubky-advanced, receipts, attestation), add:

    ```toml
    [package.metadata.trustedge]
    tier = "experimental"
    maintained = false
    ```

    **2. Reclassify facade crates (CLSF-04).**

    For `crates/receipts/Cargo.toml`:
    - Change `description` from "DEPRECATED: Use trustedge-core instead. Digital receipt system..." to "Experimental re-export facade for trustedge-core receipts. No maintenance commitment."
    - Change `keywords` from `["deprecated", ...]` to `["experimental", "cryptography", "receipts", "facade", "trustedge"]`

    For `crates/attestation/Cargo.toml`:
    - Change `description` from "DEPRECATED: Use trustedge-core instead. Hardware-backed..." to "Experimental re-export facade for trustedge-core attestation. No maintenance commitment."
    - Change `keywords` from `["deprecated", ...]` to `["experimental", "cryptography", "attestation", "facade", "trustedge"]`

    **3. Document crate tiers in workspace Cargo.toml.**

    Add a comment block in the workspace `Cargo.toml` after the `[workspace]` section (before `resolver = "2"`), documenting the 2-tier system:

    ```toml
    # Crate Classification
    #
    # Tier 1 (Stable) — production-committed, tested in CI, maintained:
    #   - trustedge-core          (core cryptographic library)
    #   - trustedge-cli           (main CLI binary)
    #   - trustedge-trst-protocols (archive format definitions)
    #   - trustedge-trst-cli      (archive CLI binary)
    #   - trustedge-trst-wasm     (browser archive verification)
    #
    # Tier 2 (Experimental) — community/experimental, build-only CI, no maintenance commitment:
    #   - trustedge-wasm          (general WASM bindings)
    #   - trustedge-pubky         (Pubky network adapter)
    #   - trustedge-pubky-advanced (Pubky hybrid encryption)
    #   - trustedge-receipts      (re-export facade, use trustedge-core directly)
    #   - trustedge-attestation   (re-export facade, use trustedge-core directly)
    ```

    **4. Verify build still works after changes.**

    Run `cargo check --workspace` to confirm no TOML parsing errors.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `cargo check --workspace` — must succeed.
    Run `cargo metadata --format-version 1 | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); pkgs={p['name']:p for p in d['packages'] if p['name'].startswith('trustedge')}; [print(f'{n}: {p.get(\"metadata\",{}).get(\"trustedge\",{}).get(\"tier\",\"MISSING\")}') for n,p in sorted(pkgs.items())]"` — all 10 crates should show their tier.
  </verify>
  <done>All 10 crates have `[package.metadata.trustedge]` tier metadata (5 stable, 5 experimental). Workspace Cargo.toml has tier documentation comment. Facade crates reclassified from deprecated to experimental. `cargo check --workspace` passes.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add experimental/beta banners to experimental crate READMEs</name>

  <action>
    Add a prominent experimental/beta banner to each of the 5 experimental crate READMEs. Insert the banner immediately after the copyright header and crate title (before any existing content).

    **Banner template** (adapt crate name and description for each):

    ```markdown
    > **EXPERIMENTAL** -- This crate is Tier 2 (experimental). It builds and passes basic checks but has no maintenance commitment. For production use, depend on `trustedge-core` directly.
    ```

    Specific banners:

    **crates/wasm/README.md** — After title:
    ```markdown
    > **EXPERIMENTAL** -- This crate is Tier 2 (experimental). General WASM bindings for TrustEdge. No maintenance commitment. For browser archive verification, use `trustedge-trst-wasm` (Tier 1) instead.
    ```

    **crates/pubky/README.md** — After title:
    ```markdown
    > **EXPERIMENTAL** -- This crate is Tier 2 (experimental). Community-contributed Pubky network adapter. No maintenance commitment.
    ```

    **crates/pubky-advanced/README.md** — After title:
    ```markdown
    > **EXPERIMENTAL** -- This crate is Tier 2 (experimental). Community-contributed Pubky hybrid encryption. No maintenance commitment.
    ```

    **crates/receipts/README.md** — After title, replacing any existing deprecation notice:
    ```markdown
    > **EXPERIMENTAL** -- This crate is Tier 2 (experimental). Re-export facade for `trustedge-core` receipts. No maintenance commitment. Depend on `trustedge-core` directly for production use.
    ```

    **crates/attestation/README.md** — After title, replacing any existing deprecation notice:
    ```markdown
    > **EXPERIMENTAL** -- This crate is Tier 2 (experimental). Re-export facade for `trustedge-core` attestation. No maintenance commitment. Depend on `trustedge-core` directly for production use.
    ```

    Read each README first to understand its structure, then insert the banner in the appropriate location. If a README has an existing deprecation notice, replace it with the experimental banner.
  </action>
  <verify>
    For each of the 5 experimental crate READMEs, confirm the banner exists:
    `grep -l "EXPERIMENTAL" crates/wasm/README.md crates/pubky/README.md crates/pubky-advanced/README.md crates/receipts/README.md crates/attestation/README.md`
    — should return all 5 files.
  </verify>
  <done>All 5 experimental crate READMEs have prominent "EXPERIMENTAL" banners with tier classification and maintenance status. Facade crate banners direct users to trustedge-core.</done>
</task>

</tasks>
