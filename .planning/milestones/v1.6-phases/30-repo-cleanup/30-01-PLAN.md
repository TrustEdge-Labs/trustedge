<objective>
Delete all orphaned repos from the TrustEdge-Labs GitHub org, leaving exactly 3 repos.

Purpose: The TrustEdge-Labs org accumulated 14 repos over multiple consolidation phases. 5 were empty scaffolds (already archived), 3 were service repos consolidated into trustedge-platform/trustedge-types, 1 is the dashboard consolidated into web/dashboard/, and 2 are utility repos (.github org profile, brand-kit) no longer needed. Deleting them makes the org reflect reality: 3 active repos.

Output: TrustEdge-Labs org with exactly 3 repos.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Delete all orphaned repos from TrustEdge-Labs org</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Audit the TrustEdge-Labs GitHub org to identify all repos beyond the 3 keepers (trustedge, trustedgelabs-website, shipsecure). Then delete each one using `gh repo delete`.

    Run `gh repo list TrustEdge-Labs --limit 50 --json name,isArchived` to get the current inventory.

    Expected repos to delete (11 total):
    1. `trustedge-billing-service` (archived scaffold)
    2. `trustedge-device-service` (archived scaffold)
    3. `trustedge-identity-service` (archived scaffold)
    4. `trustedge-infra` (archived scaffold)
    5. `trustedge-ingestion-service` (archived scaffold)
    6. `trustedge-platform-api` (consolidated into trustedge-platform in Phase 25)
    7. `trustedge-verify-core` (consolidated into trustedge-platform in Phase 25)
    8. `trustedge-shared-libs` (consolidated into trustedge-types in Phase 24)
    9. `trustedge-dashboard` (consolidated into web/dashboard/ in Phase 29)
    10. `.github` (org profile repo — org description will be set via API instead)
    11. `trustedgelabs-brand-kit` (utility repo, no longer needed)

    For each repo, run:
    ```
    gh repo delete TrustEdge-Labs/REPO_NAME --yes
    ```

    If additional repos are found beyond this list that are not one of the 3 keepers, delete them too.

    If any repo fails to delete (permissions, etc.), document the failure and continue with the remaining repos.

    After all deletions, update the GitHub org description via the API to reflect the 3-repo structure:
    ```
    gh api -X PATCH /orgs/TrustEdge-Labs -f description="Privacy and trust at the edge. Three repos: trustedge (core platform), trustedgelabs-website, shipsecure."
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `gh repo list TrustEdge-Labs --limit 50 --json name` and confirm exactly 3 repos are listed: trustedge, trustedgelabs-website, shipsecure.
  </verify>
  <done>TrustEdge-Labs org contains exactly 3 repos. All orphaned repos permanently deleted.</done>
</task>
