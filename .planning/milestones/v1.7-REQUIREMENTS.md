# Requirements: TrustEdge

**Defined:** 2026-02-22
**Core Value:** A single, reliable trustedge-core library that owns all cryptographic operations — thin CLIs and WASM bindings are just frontends.

## v1.7 Requirements

Requirements for v1.7 Security & Quality Hardening. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Secret Handling

- [x] **SEC-01**: All sensitive fields (PIN, passphrase, JWT secret) are zeroized on drop
- [x] **SEC-02**: Debug output redacts sensitive fields instead of printing plaintext
- [x] **SEC-03**: Serialize/Deserialize removed from config structs that contain secrets (YubiKeyConfig, SoftwareHsmConfig)
- [x] **SEC-04**: LoginRequest.password is not leaked via Debug or accidental serialization

### Workspace Hygiene

- [x] **WRK-01**: Deprecated facade crates (trustedge-receipts, trustedge-attestation) are deleted from workspace
- [x] **WRK-02**: CI scripts and documentation updated to remove facade references
- [x] **WRK-03**: Tier 2 experimental crates separated from Tier 1 dependency graph (pubky dep tree no longer in shared Cargo.lock)
- [x] **WRK-04**: Workspace Cargo.toml cleaned of unused workspace dependencies after separation

### Platform Quality

- [x] **PLT-01**: verify_handler shared validation logic extracted into single always-compiled function
- [x] **PLT-02**: Verify-only (non-postgres) build uses restrictive CORS instead of permissive
- [x] **PLT-03**: CA module routes either wired into router or documented as library-only

### Platform Testing

- [x] **TST-01**: Platform-server binary crate has integration tests validating AppState wiring
- [x] **TST-02**: create_test_app faithfully mirrors create_router (CORS, trace, auth middleware)
- [x] **TST-03**: Full verify round-trip tested over HTTP (valid signature, receipt returned)
