# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-09)

**Core value:** A single, reliable trustedge-core library that owns all cryptographic operations with production-quality YubiKey integration — thin CLIs and WASM bindings are just frontends.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 (Foundation)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Monolith core + thin shells: Eliminates duplication, single source of truth for crypto ops
- Best implementation wins for merges: Pragmatic — pick better code, don't union-merge everything
- Envelope encryption is the core product: YubiKey hardware signing is the differentiator
- No new features this milestone: Consolidation only — adding features while reorganizing risks bugs

### Pending Todos
