# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** A single, reliable trustedge-core library that owns all cryptographic operations — thin CLIs and WASM bindings are just frontends.
**Current focus:** v1.7 Security & Quality Hardening — Phase 31: Secret Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 31 of 34 (Secret Hardening)
Plan: — of — in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-22 — v1.7 roadmap created, 4 phases defined (31-34), 14 requirements mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%
