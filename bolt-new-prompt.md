# 🚀 TrustEdge Labs Website Enhancement - Bolt.new Prompt

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Transform my existing TrustEdge Labs website from a generic crypto library site into a professional, enterprise-grade cryptographic solution provider website. The current site dramatically undersells our production-ready capabilities and commercial potential.

## 📋 CURRENT SITUATION
**Existing Tech Stack:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with dark theme
- Vite build system  
- React Router
- Lucide React icons
- Professional design foundation ✅

**Current Problems:**
- Generic "open-source crypto tools" messaging ❌
- No mention of specific technical capabilities ❌
- Missing enterprise/commercial positioning ❌
- No live demos or performance metrics ❌
- Looks like hobby project, not commercial venture ❌

## 🎯 TRANSFORMATION GOALS
1. **Position as production-ready enterprise solution** (not hobby project)
2. **Showcase specific technical capabilities** (AES-256-GCM, WASM, hardware security)
3. **Add commercial/enterprise messaging** (pricing, support, licensing)
4. **Include interactive demonstrations** (live crypto demos)
5. **Provide concrete performance metrics** (50-200 MB/s, <1ms latency)
6. **Show real-world use cases** (IoT, healthcare, supply chain)

## Key Enhancement Requirements
