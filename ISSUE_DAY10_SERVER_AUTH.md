# Day 10: Server Authentication Implementation

## Overview
Implement server authentication features to ensure clients can verify server identity and establish secure connections.

## Acceptance Criteria

### üîë Server Certificate/Key Validation
- [ ] Add server certificate loading and validation
- [ ] Support PEM format certificates and private keys
- [ ] Validate certificate expiration and basic constraints
- [ ] Add certificate chain validation (if applicable)

### üõ°Ô∏è Mutual TLS Authentication
- [ ] Implement optional mutual TLS (mTLS) support
- [ ] Server can request client certificates
- [ ] Validate client certificates against CA or whitelist
- [ ] Graceful fallback when client cert not provided

### üè∑Ô∏è Server Identity Verification
- [ ] Hostname/IP validation against certificate Subject Alternative Names
- [ ] Support for wildcard certificates
- [ ] Certificate fingerprint verification option
- [ ] Server identity logging and reporting

### üîß Certificate Management Utilities
- [ ] CLI commands for certificate generation (dev/testing)
- [ ] Certificate information display commands
- [ ] Certificate validation testing utilities
- [ ] Self-signed certificate generation for development

## Technical Implementation

### CLI Options
```bash
# Server options
--cert-file <path>           # Server certificate file
--key-file <path>            # Server private key file
--ca-file <path>             # CA certificate for client validation
--require-client-cert        # Require client certificates (mTLS)

# Client options  
--server-cert <path>         # Expected server certificate
--verify-hostname            # Verify server hostname against cert
--ca-file <path>             # CA to validate server cert
--insecure                   # Skip certificate validation (dev only)
```

### Code Structure
- New `auth` module in both client and server
- Certificate handling utilities
- TLS configuration management
- Authentication error types

### Configuration Files
- Support for configuration files with certificate paths
- Environment variable support for certificate locations
- Secure default configurations

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Certificate parsing and validation
- [ ] TLS configuration setup
- [ ] Error handling for invalid certificates
- [ ] Hostname verification logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Server startup with valid certificates
- [ ] Client connection with certificate validation
- [ ] mTLS handshake testing
- [ ] Certificate chain validation

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Generate test certificates and CA
- [ ] Test valid certificate scenarios
- [ ] Test invalid/expired certificate handling
- [ ] Test hostname mismatch scenarios

## Documentation Updates

### Files to Update
- [ ] **CLI.md**: New authentication command-line options
- [ ] **PROTOCOL.md**: TLS/authentication protocol details
- [ ] **EXAMPLES.md**: Certificate setup and usage examples
- [ ] **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Certificate management for development
- [ ] **SECURITY.md**: Authentication security considerations

### Example Scenarios
- [ ] Basic server authentication setup
- [ ] Mutual TLS configuration
- [ ] Development certificate generation
- [ ] Production certificate deployment

## Security Considerations

### Certificate Security
- Private key protection and permissions
- Certificate storage best practices
- Key rotation preparation
- Certificate revocation awareness

### TLS Configuration
- Secure TLS versions and cipher suites
- Perfect Forward Secrecy support
- Certificate validation strictness
- Development vs production security

## Dependencies

### New Crates
- `rustls` or `native-tls` for TLS implementation
- `webpki` for certificate validation
- `x509-parser` for certificate parsing (if needed)
- `rcgen` for certificate generation utilities

### Existing Integration
- Integrate with current `tokio` async networking
- Work with existing error handling patterns
- Maintain compatibility with current CLI structure

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, manual)
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

## Estimated Effort
**2-3 days** of development work

## Related Issues
- Depends on: Day 9 network resilience (completed)
- Blocks: Day 11 client authentication
- Related to: Enhanced security features (Day 12)

## Notes
- Focus on robust error handling and clear error messages
- Ensure development experience remains smooth with self-signed certs
- Prepare foundation for Day 11 client authentication
- Consider certificate management tooling for operators
